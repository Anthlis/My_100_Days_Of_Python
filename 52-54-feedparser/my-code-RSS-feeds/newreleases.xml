		<title>Hands-On With Apple's New 7th-Generation iPod Touch</title>

		<description>Apple earlier this week introduced new &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/"&gt;iPod touch&lt;/a&gt; models, updating the 4-inch device for the first time since 2015. Not a lot has changed, but there's a new processor and updated storage tiers.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
We thought we'd go hands-on with the new &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; to see if it still has a place in Apple's lineup in 2019 and who might want to purchase one.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTwKrQbBjM8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The new 7th-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is now Apple's smallest device and the sole device that has a 4-inch display. The smallest iPhones (7 and 8) have 4.7-inch displays, so the new &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is a good bit smaller and comparable to an iPhone 5s or SE.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Coming to a 4-inch &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; from a larger iPhone is quite an adjustment because most of us are no longer used to using a device with such a small display. It's tiny and it's made from a lightweight aluminum, which is nice if you need something you can just tuck in a pocket.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/ipodtouch1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695242" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have the &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; in blue, but it's also available in five additional colors: pink, (PRODUCT)RED, silver, gold, and space gray. As with the previous-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt;, there are thick bezels at the top and bottom of the device.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The bottom bezel houses a Home button, but unlike the iPhone, there's no &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/touch-id/"&gt;Touch ID&lt;/a&gt; built in. There's also no Face ID, because the &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; has no biometric authentication system at all. You need to use a passcode for unlocking the device.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Camera tech hasn't been updated, so the new &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is still using an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2 megapixel front-facing camera, both of which are pretty far behind current camera technology in more modern Apple devices. For those who prefer wired headphones, there is a headphone jack.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The sole major update to the 7th-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is its new processor, which is an A10 Fusion chip that Apple first used in the 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-7/"&gt;iPhone 7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;!----&gt;iPhone 7&lt;!----&gt; Plus. The A10 Fusion chip is a good bit faster than the A8 chip that was in the 6th-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt;, but it's worth noting that it's underclocked in this new model compared to other A10 devices.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/ipodtouchbenchmark.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695243" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The A10 chip in the &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is running at 1.6GHz compared to 2.3GHz in the 6th-generation &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;!----&gt;iPhone 7&lt;!----&gt;, both of which use the A10 chip. Apple is undoubtedly underclocking the processor to save battery life. Since this is a 4-inch phone, it has a small battery.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; earned a single-core Geekbench score of 2722 in our testing, and a multi-core score of 4695. That's a good bit slower than the 6th-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt;, which earned a single-core score of 3520 and a multi-core score of 6079.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
It's faster than the 6th-generation iPod, though, which has a single-core Geekbench score of 1330 and a multi-core score of 2250. Apple also underclocked the A8 chip in the 6th-generation &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt;, so having a chip that runs a bit slower in an &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; isn't new.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
You can get the &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; with 32GB of storage for &amp;#36;199, while 128GB of storage will cost &amp;#36;299 and 256GB of storage (a new storage tier) will cost &amp;#36;399.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/ipodtouch2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695244" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As for the question of who the &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; is for, it's not entirely clear. This is probably a good starter device for a younger child that needs access to games, FaceTime, iMessage, and other features, but there are also potential business applications, as this is an affordable device for something like mobile checkout. It could also be useful for schools looking for inexpensive Apple devices.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
For the average person that has other Apple devices like an iPhone or &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt;, you're probably not going to want to pick up an &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; unless you have a specific use case for it, such as listening to music with wired headphones while at the gym or something. Most people aren't going to have a use for an &lt;!----&gt;iPod touch&lt;!----&gt; over an iPhone, which is likely why it received only a modest processor update.

		<description>TBWA\MAL, Apple’s longtime advertising agency partner, has made two major leadership changes, reports &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/apples-ad-agency-names-new-creative-leaders-on-iphone-and-apple-services/"&gt;Adweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Geoff Edwards and Chuck Monn are both now creative directors at MAL's LA headquarters, working under chief creative officer Brent Anderson.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/tbwacreativedirectorsapplecampaigns.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695236" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Edwards is going to be overseeing ad creation for Apple's services, such as &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;+, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, while Monn will work on iPhone-related content. In a statement, Edwards, who is new to TBWA, called Apple the "best brand in the world."&lt;blockquote&gt;"When you get a call from Brent Anderson to work on the best brand in the world, in the house that Lee Clow and Steve Jobs built, the decision is easy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Edwards previously worked at R/GA on advertisements for companies like Nike, Disney, and Pepsi, while Monn has spent the past 20 years at TBWA working on campaigns promoting Mac, iPhone, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/15/apple-behind-the-mac-ads/"&gt;recent "Behind the Mac" series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/30/tbwa-new-apple-ad-leaders/"&gt;Apple&amp;#039;s Ad Agency TBWA\MAL Appoints New Leaders for Apple Services and iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-ad-agency-tbwa-mal-appoints-new-leaders-for-apple-services-and-iphone.2183331/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>&lt;a href="https://throwboy.com"&gt;Throwboy&lt;/a&gt; makes a variety of &lt;a href="https://throwboy.com/collections/shop"&gt;Apple-themed pillows&lt;/a&gt;, including the Iconic Pillow Collection, which started out as a Kickstarter but is now available from the Throwboy website.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
There are five pillows in the Iconic Pillow Collection, which have been designed to look like some of the most important products Apple has released over the years, including the Apple II, the original Macintosh, the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; G3, the iPod, and the iPhone.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyfullcollection.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694997" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All of the pillows are made from a soft plush material with a short pile, though displays and other accents are often made of felt or are embroidered on. The fabric is fuzzy and fun to touch and hold, and the stuffing inside is pliable with just the right amount of plushy give when squeezed.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyimacg3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694998" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The pillows are all priced at &amp;#36;39.99, but come in different sizes. The Macs, for example, are a good deal larger in volume than the iPhone and the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; and take up more space. Given the size differences I'm surprised the pillows all have the same price point, especially because some of the Macs are also more detailed just due to the greater number of components that needed to be replicated.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboymacs2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694999" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Throwboy's iPhone pillow is modeled after the original iPhone, which was released in 2007. That iPhone featured a silver body, and so the body of the pillow is made from a silver-gray material. The top and the bottom bezels are constructed from the same plush material in black, while the screen is a slightly different material with a different shade of black to make it stand out.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyiphoneipad.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695000" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I think the iPhone pillow would stand out more with icons on the display, but obviously that's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more embroidery, so this simpler version works, though it's less visually impressive than some of the others just because of all the black. There's an embroidered Home button, the volume button rocker on the side, power button, a mute switch, speaker and microphone, and a round camera cutout at the back.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyiphone.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="614" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695001" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It's faithful to the design of the original iPhone and it's going to be recognizable as an iPhone. The iPhone is the smallest of all the pillows (13 x 7 x 3 inches), so if you're aiming for an Apple pillow that doesn't take up a lot of space, this is the one to get.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyiconiccollection1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695002" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The iPod pillow is similar to the iPhone pillow, but a bit larger and thicker, with more defined edges. It's made of a white plush material with a gray back and is modeled after the original iPod released in 2001. There's a yellow plush display and an embroidered click wheel, along with embroidered buttons at the top.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyipodfront.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="631" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695003" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The iPod pillow is one of my favorites of the bunch because it's so recognizable and it's just super cute sitting on a couch or in a chair. It's a little bit more huggable than the iPhone because of its slightly larger size, measuring in at 13 inches by 8.5 inches by 4 inches.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyipodback.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="565" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695004" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Of the Mac pillows, the classic Macintosh pillow is probably my favorite. It measures in at around 10 inches by 8 inches by 11 inches, and it's kind of the perfect couch pillow size. It's definitely the cutest design of the Mac bunch, made from a plush beige material with a black plush display area, an embroidered floppy drive, and a rainbow pillow logo.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
At the back, there's detailing that matches all of the components of the 1984 machine. It's impressively intricate, with fan grilles, speaker cutouts, and other embroidered components, plus it's shaped just like a classic Mac, only plushier.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyclassicmac2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="556" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695006" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The &lt;!----&gt;iMac&lt;!----&gt; G3 pillow, designed to look like one of Apple's colorful iMacs in an aqua color, is the puffiest of the bunch and the nicest to squeeze or hug. It's my second favorite of the Mac pillows, and the most colorful pillow of the bunch thanks to those blue accents. It's about 13 inches by 9 inches by 8 inches, making it a little bit bigger than the others.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyimacfront.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="494" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695007" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The display at the front is made from a plush gray material, with white plush around it and a blue plush fabric for the back. The speakers and disk drive are embroidered on, and the back features the classic &lt;!----&gt;iMac&lt;!----&gt; G3 design with handle. There are even little blue embroidered feet at the bottom.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyimacback.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="544" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695008" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The 1977 pillow, which mimics the Apple II, is one of the larger pillows, measuring in at 13 inches by 5 inches by 13 inches. The Apple II was a bit of a weird looking computer, and it doesn't translate into pillow form as well as some of the other products because of its design. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyappleiifront.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="570" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695009" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like on the other pillows, the detailing is exquisite, though, and there's really no mistaking that this is an Apple II. All of the keys are embroidered on, and there's a rainbow pillow logo on the display portion of the pillow. It's made of a beige material, with black material at the back.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Though called pillows, these are more akin to plush toys as there are no removable components. You can't disassemble these for washing purposes, which is something to keep in mind. You may be able to wash them on a gentle cycle in a pillowcase as you can sometimes do with plush toys, but I'm not sure how that would affect the embroidery. (Update: Throwboy says the pillows can indeed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv8ABHYWEwY"&gt;be washed&lt;/a&gt; on the gentle cycle with cold water, and dried on a gentle cycle or line dried). 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboymacs3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="666" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695010" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All of these pillows come with two Throwboy tags, one at the back and one at the side. It's also worth noting that they all have a pillow-style logo in place of the traditional Apple logo where appropriate.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;#36;39.99 might seem expensive for a pillow, but these are priced competitively with pillows and stuffed toys that share a similar intricate design, so the pricing seems about appropriate for the quality and the build.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Throwboy's Iconic Collection pillows are soft, plush, huggable, and perfect as an alternative to a traditional throw pillow. Anyone who loves Apple products is going to like Throwboy's pillows, making them an excellent choice for office or home decor or to give as a gift.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/throwboyiconiccollection2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695011" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I like how soft and cuddly these pillows are -- they really are comfortable for a quick nap or to lean against on a couch or chair. It's also sometimes just nice to hug something super squishable, and these are perfect.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
People old enough to have used these devices are going to love the throwback vibe, so if you're a longtime Apple fan, it's worth picking up a pillow or two.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All of the pillows in the Iconic collection can be &lt;a href="https://throwboy.com/collections/shop"&gt;purchased from the Throwboy website&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;#36;39.99 each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/throwboy-iconic-pillow-collection/"&gt;Review: Throwboy&amp;#039;s Iconic Pillows Let You Decorate With Classic Apple Product Designs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-throwboys-iconic-pillows-let-you-decorate-with-classic-apple-product-designs.2183312/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Apple shipped an estimated 12.8 million wearable devices globally in the first calendar quarter of 2019, according to new data shared today by &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45115019"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;. The wearables category includes &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and select Beats headphones.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple earned 25.8 percent market share during the quarter, making it the top wearables company, and growth was way up. In Q1 2018, Apple shipped an estimated 8.6 million devices, marking 49.5 percent growth year-over-year.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/idcwearablesq12019.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695207" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chinese companies Xiaomi and Huawei were Apple's closest competitors with 6.6 and 5 million devices shipped, respectively, while Samsung and Fitbit took the fourth and fifth places with 4.3 and 2.9 million devices shipped, respectively.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/idcwearablesbycompanyq12019.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="526" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695208" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In total, there were 49.6 million wearable devices shipped during the first quarter of 2019, up 55.2 percent from the first quarter of 2018.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Splitting the data up by wrist-worn devices only, IDC believes Apple shipped an estimated 4.6 million devices, up from 4 million in the year-ago quarter. Apple was not the top company when it comes to wrist-worn wearables, with that spot going to Xiaomi.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/idcwristworndevicesq12019.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695209" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Xiaomi shipped an estimated 5.3 million wrist-worn wearable devices for 10.7 percent market share, slightly higher than Apple's 9.3 percent market share.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Huawei, Fitbit, and Samsung all trailed after Xiaomi and Apple, shipping 3.9, 2.9, and 2 million devices respectively during the first quarter of 2019. According to IDC, Apple's ASP for the &lt;!----&gt;Apple Watch&lt;!----&gt; jumped from &amp;#36;426 in Q1 2018 to &amp;#36;455 in Q1 2019.&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple maintained the leading position as the company offers three product lines; &lt;!----&gt;Apple Watch&lt;!----&gt;, &lt;!----&gt;AirPods&lt;!----&gt;, and select Beats headphones. The &lt;!----&gt;Apple Watch&lt;!----&gt; in particular has proven to be highly successful at capturing unit share, but more importantly dollar share as the average selling price (ASP) of these watches has increased from &amp;#36;426 in 1Q18 to &amp;#36;455 in the latest quarter. Apple also seems to be employing a similar strategy in its wireless headphone lineup as the latest &lt;!----&gt;AirPods&lt;!----&gt; are now available with wireless charging and an increased ASP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apple has refreshed its &lt;!----&gt;Apple Watch&lt;!----&gt; every year since the device was introduced in 2015. In 2018, the &lt;!----&gt;Apple Watch&lt;!----&gt; Series 4 brought new ECG health features and an updated design with slimmer bezels. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/#whats_next_for_the_apple_watch"&gt;rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; we could see new casing materials and perhaps new display technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/idc/"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/30/apple-wearables-12-8-million-shipments-q1-2019/"&gt;Apple Sees Strong Wearables Growth With 12.8 Million Shipments in Q1 2019&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sees-strong-wearables-growth-with-12-8-million-shipments-in-q1-2019.2183310/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Amazon is discounting Apple's Smart Keyboard for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air by 50 percent. This means you can get the accessory for &amp;#36;79.50, a new all-time low price for the 10.5-inch version of the Smart Keyboard.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/03/ipadairsmartkeyboard2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-684854" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Smart Keyboard connects to the iPad's Smart Connector port, providing a physical QWERTY keyboard to the touchscreen tablet and making it easier to type in apps like Notes and Messages. When folded, the accessory also acts as a protection for the iPad's display.

		<description>Sprint today &lt;a href="https://newsroom.sprint.com/sprint-lights-up-true-mobile-5g-in-atlanta-dallas-fort-worth-houston-and-kansas-city.htm"&gt;announced the initial launch&lt;/a&gt; of its mobile 5G network, bringing 5G connectivity to Sprint customers in areas of Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Kansas City.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Over the course of the next few weeks, Sprint expects to expand 5G availability to areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix, and Washington D.C.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94tHT0HV71k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At the foundation of Sprint 5G is Massive MIMO, a breakthrough technology that dramatically improves network capacity. Sprint is using 64T64R (64 transmitters 64 receivers) 5G Massive MIMO radios from Ericsson in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Kansas City. These radios support split-mode, enabling Sprint to simultaneously deliver LTE Advanced and 5G NR service. Sprint's 5G Massive MIMO radios run on its 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum, and they are deployed on Sprint's existing 4G cell sites, providing a nearly identical footprint for both 2.5 GHz LTE and 5G NR coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early 5G networks are limited in scope and are available in small areas in the above listed cities, with residents of those areas able to check out the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.sprint.com/sprint-lights-up-true-mobile-5g-in-atlanta-dallas-fort-worth-houston-and-kansas-city.htm"&gt;Sprint press release&lt;/a&gt; for specific data on where 5G will be available.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The type of 5G network that Sprint is rolling out uses millimeter wave spectrum, which offers blazing fast data transfer speeds but is sensitive to interference and limited in range, making it best suited to use in urban areas because it can't cover wide swathes of land.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
In rural and suburban areas, U.S. carriers, including Sprint, will roll out 5G networks on mid-bands and low-bands, aka sub-6GHz 5G. T-Mobile, the company Sprint is hoping to merge with, is focusing heavily on this more widespread connectivity.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Non mmWave 5G technology won't be as fast as the speeds possible with mmWave, but it will bring improvements over current 4G LTE networks. Sprint says its mmWave 5G technology is 10 times faster than LTE.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Sprint is, in the future, aiming to expand its 5G network through its merger with T-Mobile, though there are concerns that it &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/20/doj-leaning-against-tmobile-sprint-merger/"&gt;won't be approved&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-29/u-s-wants-t-mobile-to-create-fourth-competitor-as-part-of-deal"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; suggests the United States Justice Department wants to require T-Mobile and Sprint to "lay the groundwork" for a new wireless carrier (to create a fourth competitor) as a condition for the government allowing the merger to proceed.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Connecting to a 5G network requires a smartphone that supports 5G, and there are few on the market at the current time. Options include the LG ThinQ 5G and the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
There are no iPhones that are able to connect to 5G networks at the current time, and Apple is not expected to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/"&gt;release a 5G device&lt;/a&gt; until 2020. Rumors suggest 2020 iPhones will feature &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-chips-5g-iphones-2020/"&gt;5G chips from Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; of the legal woes between Qualcomm and Apple along with Intel's decision to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/intel-exits-5g-smartphone-modem-business/"&gt;drop out&lt;/a&gt; of the 5G chip market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/sprint/"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/5g/"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/5g-iphone/"&gt;5G iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/30/sprint-launches-mobile-5g-network/"&gt;Sprint Launches Mobile 5G Network in Four U.S. Cities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sprint-launches-mobile-5g-network-in-four-u-s-cities.2183302/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off next week at the San Jose Convention Center, and ahead of the festivities, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/05/thousands-of-stories-one-wwdc/"&gt;shared a press release&lt;/a&gt; that highlights two of the over 5,000 people who will be attending this year.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/erika-hairston-wwdc-2019.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695159" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erika Hairston, left, at Apple Entrepreneur Camp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The first is Erika Hairston, a 23-year-old Yale grad working in San Francisco who recently launched her first app named Zimela to promote diversity in tech. The second is David Niemeijer, a 50-year-old from Amsterdam who founded AssistiveWare, a company that designs communication aids for people with disabilities.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Hairston designed Zimela to help underrepresented groups enter tech by establishing mentorships and making users aware of career placement opportunities, like internships, according to Apple. She also recently completed the Apple Entrepreneur Camp for app-driven businesses that are owned or led by women.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Niemeijer designed a virtual keyboard that could be controlled using a mouse alternative that eventually became the program KeyStrokes. In 2001, a KeyStrokes user emailed Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs to ask if KeyStrokes could be integrated into macOS, kicking off a nearly two-decade relationship with Apple. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple is set to host &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/"&gt;WWDC 2019&lt;/a&gt;'s opening keynote on Monday at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, where it is widely expected to unveil &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-13/"&gt;iOS 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/"&gt;macOS 10.15&lt;/a&gt;, watchOS 6, tvOS 13, and more.

		<description>A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitepanda/status/1133847982317723648"&gt;video of a smoking MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is gaining attention on Twitter and Reddit after being shared by a DJ known as White Panda, who claims that the notebook suddenly "&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/bulbhv/my_macbook_pro_exploded_and_burst_into_flames/"&gt;exploded and burst into flames&lt;/a&gt;" on Tuesday during normal use. The cause is unconfirmed, but a failed lithium-ion battery is likely to blame.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/macbook-pro-smoking.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695123" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The backstory:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yesterday afternoon my &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; exploded during normal use. It was on my lap, plugged in, and suddenly started to spew smoke out both sides. I quickly placed it on the floor where it popped, the smoke increased, and it caught fire. Toxic smelling smoke filled my house triggering smoke and CO alarms. No one was injured, thankfully, but there was some damage to my home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; is a 2015 model with a 15-inch Retina display, according to White Panda. Two repairs to the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt;'s display and trackpad were completed by Apple under warranty during its lifetime, but the notebook has never had any third-party repairs and has no aftermarket parts, he says.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; exploded today during normal use. No injuries, luckily. Some damage to the house. Could have been worse - good thing I wasn’t on a plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very curious to see how &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; responds.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MacRumors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/9to5mac?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@9to5mac&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pjmpv5Mx9b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pjmpv5Mx9b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; White Panda (@whitepanda) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/whitepanda/status/1133847982317723648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 29, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
While the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; was allegedly charging when the incident occurred, it is unclear if an Apple power adapter or aftermarket charger was used. (&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; White Panda has since said he was using an Apple power adapter.)
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
After allowing the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; to cool down for roughly an hour, White Panda says he took the notebook to an Apple Store, where employees allegedly placed it in a fireproof safe for 24 hours as a mandatory safety precaution.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple has since "escalated" the matter and said it would be in touch within five days, according to the DJ. Apple has yet to respond to our request for comment, but the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; will likely be sent to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino to be investigated by its product engineers, as is typical in these situations.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
While unfortunate and dangerous, this is an isolated incident. The reality is that Apple produces millions of lithium-ion batteries, and while they are typically safe, a very small percentage may experience failure.

		<description>Lexus today &lt;a href="http://pressroom.lexus.com/releases/2020-lexus-rx-and-rxl-open-a-new-chapter-for-the-iconic-luxury-crossover.htm"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/"&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt; and Android Auto will be standard features in its new 2020 Lexus RX in the United States, marking the first time that either software platform is available in the luxury crossover SUV.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/2020-lexus-rx-carplay.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695072" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;CarPlay&lt;!----&gt; and Android Auto will be accessible through an 8-inch touchscreen display that is standard in all models of the 2020 Lexus RX. A larger 12.3-inch split-screen touchscreen is available as an upgrade option. &lt;!----&gt;CarPlay&lt;!----&gt; appears to be wired, so the iPhone will have to be connected with a Lightning to USB cable.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The new RX will enter production in the third quarter of 2019, according to Lexus. Pricing will be announced closer to the on-sale date.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/2020-lexus-rx.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="462" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695075" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;CarPlay&lt;!----&gt; provides convenient access to frequently used iPhone apps such as Phone, Messages, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-maps/"&gt;Apple Maps&lt;/a&gt;, Google Maps, Waze, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, and Spotify directly from the dashboard. The platform was introduced in 2014 and is now &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/"&gt;available in over 500 vehicle models&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, according to Apple.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Lexus and its parent company Toyota were &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/15/toyota-to-support-apple-carplay/"&gt;among the last major automakers to adopt CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;, but the duo now offer Apple's software platform in nearly two dozen vehicle models, ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/26/toyota-corolla-carplay/"&gt;latest Corolla&lt;/a&gt; to the latest Lexus LS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Related Roundup: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/"&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/lexus/"&gt;Lexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/30/2020-lexus-rx-apple-carplay-android-auto/"&gt;Lexus RX Finally Getting CarPlay and Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lexus-rx-finally-getting-carplay-and-android-auto.2183275/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Apple is working closely with London's transport network (TfL) to enable &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; Express Transit, a feature which allows riders to pay their fare without needing to wake or unlock their device, or authenticate with Face ID, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/touch-id/"&gt;Touch ID&lt;/a&gt;, or a passcode.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/apple-pay-london-underground.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="924" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695048" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk"&gt;TfL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
"We are having positive discussions with Apple about enabling express transit on Apple devices on the TfL network," a TfL spokesperson said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645394/apple-pay-express-transit-london-tfl-tube-support-uk"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. "More information about timing and plans will be available at a future date."
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
TfL's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TfL/status/1129130167505444864"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; also noted that the company is "working closely with Apple to allow the benefits of this update to be introduced on London’s transport network in the coming months."
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Users of London's transport network can already use &lt;!----&gt;Apple Pay&lt;!----&gt; for ride purchases at Oyster terminals and gates, but they must first authenticate with Face ID, &lt;!----&gt;Touch ID&lt;!----&gt;, or passcode. Express Transit would change all that with its tap-and-go system, speeding up entry into subway and train stations in the process.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;Apple Pay&lt;!----&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207958"&gt;Express Transit&lt;/a&gt; mode can be used on iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s Plus or later, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 1 and 2 or later. Owners of &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xs/"&gt;iPhone XS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;!----&gt;iPhone XS&lt;!----&gt; Max, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/"&gt;iPhone XR&lt;/a&gt; can also use Express Transit in power reserve mode, which is available for up to five hours when an iPhone needs to be charged.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple introduced Express Transit in iOS 12.3, which was released earlier this month. London would join a handful of cities with transit systems that support the express &lt;!----&gt;Apple Pay&lt;!----&gt; feature, including Beijing, Shanghai, Portland, and New York City (from Friday). Express Transit also works for Suica cards in Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/"&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/united-kingdom/"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/30/apple-pay-express-transit-coming-to-london/"&gt;Apple Pay Express Transit Coming to London &amp;#039;in the Coming Months&amp;#039;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-express-transit-coming-to-london-in-the-coming-months.2183267/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Apple and other tech giants have joined civil society groups and security experts in condemning proposals from Britain's cybersecurity agency that would enable law enforcement to access end-to-end encrypted messages (via &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/30/apple-google-and-whatsapp-condemn-gchq-ghost-proposal.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/1280px-GCHQ-aerial.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695040" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Government's Communications HQ in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In an &lt;a href="https://newamericadotorg.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Coalition_Letter_to_GCHQ_on_Ghost_Proposal_-_May_22_2019.pdf"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the U.K.'s GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters), 47 signatories including Apple, Google and WhatsApp urged the U.K. eavesdropping agency to ditch plans for its so-called "ghost protocol," which would require encrypted messaging services to direct a message to a third recipient, at the same time as sending it to its intended user.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Ian Levy, the technical director of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, and Crispin Robinson, GCHQ's head of cryptanalysis, &lt;a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate"&gt;published details&lt;/a&gt; of the proposal in November 2018. In the essay, Levy and Robinson claimed the system would enable law enforcement to access the content of encrypted messages without breaking the encryption. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The officials argued it would be "relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call," and claimed this would be "no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips," which are currently used in wiretaps of non-encrypted chat and call apps.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Signatories of the letter opposing the plan argued that the proposal required two changes to existing communications systems that were a "serious threat" to digital security and fundamental human rights, and would undermine user trust.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"First, it would require service providers to surreptitiously inject a new public key into a conversation in response to a government demand. This would turn a two-way conversation into a group chat where the government is the additional participant, or add a secret government participant to an existing group chat. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
"Second, in order to ensure the government is added to the conversation in secret, GCHQ's proposal would require messaging apps, service providers, and operating systems to change their software so that it would 1) change the encryption schemes used, and/or 2) mislead users by suppressing the notifications that routinely appear when a new communicant joins a chat.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
"The overwhelming majority of users rely on their confidence in reputable providers to perform authentication functions and verify that the participants in a conversation are the people they think they are, and only those people. The GCHQ's ghost proposal completely undermines this trust relationship and the authentication process."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apple's strong stance against weakened device protections for the sake of law enforcement access was highlighted in the 2016 Apple vs. FBI conflict that saw Apple refuse to create a backdoor access solution to allow the FBI to crack the iPhone 5c owned by San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Responding to the open letter, which was first sent to GCHQ on May 22, the National Cyber Security Centre's Ian Levy told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;: "We welcome this response to our request for thoughts on exceptional access to data — for example to stop terrorists. The hypothetical proposal was always intended as a starting point for discussion."
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
"We will continue to engage with interested parties and look forward to having an open discussion to reach the best solutions possible," Levy said.

		<description>Brydge, known for its line of keyboards for the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, recently debuted its newest keyboard, an updated model designed for Apple's 2018 11 and 12.9-inch &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; models. The &lt;a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-for-ipad-pro-2018"&gt;new Brydge Pro&lt;/a&gt; has been highly anticipated by &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; owners who have used Brydge keyboards in the past and prefer the bulk-free Brydge keyboard style.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I've teamed up with &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; videographer Dan Barbera to review the Brydge Pro, so make sure to check out his hands-on video below to get a visual overview of the keyboard and read on for my own review.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhhD454Kqx4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you're familiar with Brydge keyboards, the Bluetooth-enabled Brydge Pro features the same general design as past Brydge options. It is the least bulky of the third-party keyboards for the new &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; models that I've used, and it's my favorite third-party keyboard design by far.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgepro.jpg" alt="Brydge Pro keyboard" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694978" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are two rubber-lined hinged clips on the keyboard that your &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; fits into, which hold it securely in place and mimic a &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook/"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; setup. The clips move forwards and backwards so you can fold it up just like you would a laptop (and when you close it, there are little rubber nubs to prevent the keys from touching the display). Because of the rubber lining, the &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; is secure and stable in the Brydge Pro, but I have noticed that the weight of the &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; can cause to it flip backwards a bit when I pick it up using the keyboard portion.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgepronoipad2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694979" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The hinges are tighter than a &lt;!----&gt;MacBook&lt;!----&gt; hinge, but it's still easy to open and close the keyboard and the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt;, and when you close it up, the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt;'s screen turns off. With the clips, there's an adjustable 180 degree viewing angle, which is nice because it lets you position the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; at whatever angle works best for you regardless of whether you're typing on a flat surface like a desk or in your lap. On a desk, there are rubber feet at the bottom to keep it in place, which is a nice addition. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeproclips.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694980" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can only rotate the clips a limited amount, so if you want to use your &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; in portrait mode, you're going to need to take it out of the keyboard, which is a bit of a hassle. There's no option to just fold it back, though I guess you could use it book style. You can pull the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; out and stick it back in backwards to use the keyboard in tablet mode (folded back) or movie mode (no keyboard visible but &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; propped up) but it's a hassle to have to take it out and put it in the clips.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprotabletview.jpg" alt="Brydge Pro tablet view" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694981" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;Brydge Pro tablet view&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This isn't a traditional folio style case, but there is a magnetic back cover that's similar to a Smart Cover in both thickness and design. It's meant to protect the back of the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; when the keyboard is attached, and there are cutouts for the portion of the Brydge Pro that holds the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; in place. Since this cover isn't blocking the side of the &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt;, you can still attach and charge your &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pencil/"&gt;Apple Pencil&lt;/a&gt; 2.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprovideomode.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694982" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;Brydge Pro movie view&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Brydge Pro is made from aluminum and is available in either space gray or silver to match Apple's iPads. It's heavy and adds a good pound to the weight of the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt;, but I do appreciate that it's much thinner than competing third-party keyboard options. Brydge says that it measures in at 15.6mm with the &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt;, compared to 22.5mm for the Logitech Slim Folio Pro.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprothickness.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694983" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I've noticed during daily use that when I open and close the Brydge Pro several times my &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; has a tendency to scoot its way out of the clips a bit, which can be an irritation. On the whole, though, I love the design of the Brydge Pro because of the minimal bulk and because of the way it mimics a &lt;!----&gt;MacBook&lt;!----&gt;. I can't tell you how many times I went to use the trackpad during this review because the Brydge Pro had such a &lt;!----&gt;MacBook&lt;!----&gt; vibe, but I did it a lot.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprocover2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694984" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At one side of the Brydge Pro, there's a single USB-C port, which is used for charging. You can check battery level on the keyboard itself using a battery button, but Brydge says you should only need to charge about once a year depending on how often you're using the keyboard. Like all third-party keyboards for the new &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; models, the Brydge Pro is a Bluetooth keyboard and connects to the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; over Bluetooth. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The keys on the Brydge Pro are soft and aren't as satisfying to press as the keys on the Logitech Folio and they're nowhere near as firm as the keys on a 2016 or later &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a better typing experience than the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/smart-keyboard/"&gt;Smart Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; Folio from Apple, for the most part.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
You know how Apple says butterfly keys are designed to be accurate and provide the same press no matter where you're hitting the key? These keys on the Brydge Pro are the opposite. They're squishy and don't feel particularly stable to hit, so it's not my favorite typing experience.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgepronoipad.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694985" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I had a hard time adjusting to the keys on the Brydge Pro, and I'm not entirely sure why. They're soft and also quite small, which meant I wasn't always hitting them accurately given the spacing between them, and at times, it almost felt like there was some lag that was resulting in missed key presses. Thankfully autocorrect mostly made up for it, but I needed to press harder on the keys than I'm used to in order to get my key presses to register accurately.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
It took me about 15 minutes to figure out that I wasn't experiencing lag, but needed to type in a more deliberate way with more force on each key and a more accurate press. I've never thought of myself as a light typer, but I guess using the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt;/&lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; &lt;!----&gt;Smart Keyboard&lt;!----&gt; Folio has taught me to use less force. I'm not a fan of the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; keyboard in general due to its penchant for failure, but I have come to &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the stable feel of the keys. The Brydge Pro is quite different from the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; keyboard, which could be a plus for those who aren't into the feel of the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; keys.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprofront.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694986" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I used the Brydge Pro to type this entire review and on the whole, I found it to be a frustrating experience until I got used to the amount of force the keys require and until I adjusted to the spacing between the keys. It's still not an entirely comfortable experience for me because I'm so used to pressing more lightly on the &lt;!----&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;!----&gt; keyboard, but I was able to type at close to the same speed that I can get to with a keyboard I'm more accustomed to.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
For those who have owned Brydge keyboards in the past, I don't think the Brydge Pro is offering up the same typing experience. There are definite changes to key feel in this model.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I generally think that most people are going to be able to adjust to the Brydge Pro keyboard, but it's possible that this is a key feel that isn't going to suit everyone. Compared to something like the Logitech Folio Keyboard for the &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt;, I think the Brydge Pro's keys aren't quite as nice nor as immediately easy to adapt to.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeprosideview.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694987" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are a number of function row keys with special abilities when connected to an iOS device, such as options to get to the Home screen, adjust the brightness, bring up the onscreen keyboard, adjust volume, connect to Bluetooth devices, check battery level, and power the keyboard on and off.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
This is a backlit keyboard, which is nice because that's something that Apple's &lt;!----&gt;Smart Keyboard&lt;!----&gt; Folio doesn't offer. It's just an on/off setting, though, with no way to adjust the brightness.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I'm a huge fan of the design of the Brydge Pro, and though it's still heavier than the &lt;!----&gt;Smart Keyboard&lt;!----&gt; Folio from Apple, it adds a lot less bulk than something like the Slim Folio Pro from Logitech or Zagg's similar keyboard. It's also easier to get off than these options, so you can keep it with you and pull it out only when you need it.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
I've used Brydge keyboards in the past, and I've always thought they offered up the most &lt;!----&gt;MacBook&lt;!----&gt;-like experience out of any of the third-party keyboard options. I love that this version comes with a back cover to keep the &lt;!----&gt;iPad&lt;!----&gt; safe. It's a great new update.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/brydgeproback.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694988" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, the miss here for me is the keyboard. I just don't like these keys. They're too small and too soft, with too much spacing between them. I had a hard time adjusting to the feel of the keys and I made a lot of typing errors trying to get used to the amount of force and precision that I needed to type.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
That said, other people may prefer the softer key feel and may not have the same adjustment issues because keyboard likes and dislikes vary a lot between people. I was still able to type at close to full speed, and I did eventually adjust and get a little better at it, but it's never going to be my favorite keyboard when it comes to key feel.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Choosing between the Brydge Pro, the Smart Cover Folio from Apple, or something like the Slim Folio from Logitech is going to come down to personal preference. If you want the thinnest option, go with the Smart Cover Folio. Compared to other options, it's whisper thin.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
If you want the most &lt;!----&gt;MacBook&lt;!----&gt;-like experience with an amount of bulk that's not overwhelming, choose the Brydge Pro. If you want the absolute best key feel out of the bunch and don't mind the added size, choose the Logitech Slim Folio.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Brydge Pro for &lt;!----&gt;iPad Pro&lt;!----&gt; can be &lt;a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-for-ipad-pro-2018"&gt;pre-ordered from the Brydge website&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-inch model is priced at &amp;#36;149.99, while the 12.9-inch model is priced at &amp;#36;169.99.

		<description>Flipboard today emailed Flipboard users to let them know about &lt;a href="https://about.flipboard.com/support-information-incident-May-2019/?utm_campaign=security-notice&amp;amp;utm_medium=security-notice&amp;amp;utm_source=email"&gt;a security breach&lt;/a&gt; that saw usernames, email addresses, and protected passwords accessed by hackers.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Between June 2, 2018 and April 22, 2019, there was "unauthorized access" to Flipboard databases that leaked account information. Flipboard says the hackers "potentially obtained copies" of some databases, and has not yet shared details on how many accounts were compromised.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/flipboardsecuritybreach.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694992" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Databases included Flipboard usernames, names, email addresses, and passwords, but the passwords were salted and hashed, which means they weren't stored in plaintext and would be difficult to crack.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Also included were digital tokens used to connect Flipboard to third party services like Twitter or Facebook, if users had indeed connected their Flipboard accounts to their social media networks.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Flipboard is resetting all user passwords and replacing or deleting all digital tokens. If you connected Flipboard to Facebook or Twitter, you will need to reconnect your accounts.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Flipboard says that to prevent something like this from happening again, it has implemented "enhanced security measures." Law enforcement officials have also been notified.

		<description>&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-495884" src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/03/safaripreviewicon.jpg" alt="safaripreviewicon" width="200" height="200" /&gt;Apple today &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/"&gt;released a new update&lt;/a&gt; for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple &lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/"&gt;first introduced&lt;/a&gt; three years ago in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Safari Technology Preview release 83 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Storage Access API, Rendering, Service Workers, CSS, WebRTC, WebDriver, Web API, and Web Inspector. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The new Safari Technology Preview update is available for both macOS High Sierra and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-14/"&gt;macOS Mojave&lt;/a&gt;, the newest version of the Mac operating system that was released to the public in September 2018.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-app-store/"&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/"&gt;downloaded the browser&lt;/a&gt;. Full release notes for the update are available &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/"&gt;on the Safari Technology Preview website&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple’s aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/safari-technology-preview/"&gt;Safari Technology Preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/29/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-83/"&gt;Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 83 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-83-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2183170/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/05/29/insert-data-from-picture-take-analog-data-digital/"&gt;today announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Excel app for iOS is gaining the Insert Data from Picture feature that was previously made available on Android devices.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Insert Data from Picture lets you take a photo of data in a table format and convert it to a digital format in Excel. You can capture financial spreadsheets, work schedules, task lists, time tables, and more, so long as it's in a table format to begin with.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/microsoftexceldatapicture.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="703" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694940" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
According to Microsoft, Insert Data from Picture combines optical character recognition technology, layout understanding techniques, and machine learning to convert information written on paper into digital data.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
As of today, the Insert Data from Picture feature also supports 21 languages on both iOS and Android.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Excel iOS app from Microsoft can be downloaded from the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; for free. [&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-excel/id586683407?mt=8"&gt;Direct Link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/29/excel-ios-insert-data-from-picture/"&gt;Microsoft Brings &amp;#039;Insert Data From Picture&amp;#039; Excel Feature to iOS Devices&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-brings-insert-data-from-picture-excel-feature-to-ios-devices.2183168/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>Apple is widely expected to unveil the next major version of macOS at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference next week, and rumors suggest that the update will introduce &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/10/macos-10-15-music-podcasts-apps/"&gt;standalone apps for Music and Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also confirmed that its TV app will be expanding to the Mac in the fall.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Now, we have our first glimpse at what the Music and TV apps should look like courtesy of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/29/macos-10-15-music-tv-app-screenshots/"&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;'s Guilherme Rambo, who has leaked screenshots of each app. Rambo says the screenshots are legitimate, rather than mockups or concepts, although parts have been redacted to protect his sources.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The report claims the new Music app is based on iTunes, as evident by the similar design language. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; sections including For You, Browse, and Radio are listed in the sidebar with playback controls up top.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/mac-music-app.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694929" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music app via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The new TV app is shown with a toolbar for switching between Watch Now, Movies, TV Shows, Kids, and Library sections. The sidebar contains the Library subsections of Recently Added, Movies, TV Shows, and Downloaded along with genres such as Action and Adventure, Comedy, Drama, and Kids.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/mac-tv-app.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="541" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694930" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;TV app via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The screenshots are not particularly revealing since some information has been redacted, but they provide a good glimpse of the overall look and feel of Music and TV on Mac. No screenshots of the rumored Podcasts app were shared.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Apple should unveil &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/"&gt;macOS 10.15&lt;/a&gt; at its &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/"&gt;WWDC 2019&lt;/a&gt; keynote on Monday at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Recent trademark activity uncovered by MacRumors suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/28/macos-10-15-name/"&gt;macOS 10.15 could be named macOS Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, with other potential options including macOS Monterey, macOS Rincon, and macOS Skyline.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
MacRumors will have full coverage of &lt;!----&gt;WWDC 2019&lt;!----&gt; on our website and on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/macrumorslive"&gt;@MacRumorsLive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Related Roundups: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-12/"&gt;tvOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/"&gt;macOS 10.15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-music/"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="linkback"&gt;Buyer's Guide: &lt;a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV"&gt;Apple TV (Don't Buy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/29/apple-music-tv-mac-apps-leaked-screenshots/"&gt;Apple&amp;#039;s Upcoming Music and TV Apps on Mac Revealed in Leaked Screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com"&gt;MacRumors.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-upcoming-music-and-tv-apps-on-mac-revealed-in-leaked-screenshots.2183166/"&gt;Discuss this article&lt;/a&gt; in our forums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

		<description>As expected, subscription-based magazine service &lt;a href="https://www.texture.com"&gt;Texture&lt;/a&gt; has shut down following the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/"&gt;Apple News&lt;/a&gt;+ in late March.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/texture-goodbye.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="526" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694907" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/12/apple-acquires-texture/"&gt;Apple acquired Texture last year&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the foundation of &lt;!----&gt;Apple News&lt;!----&gt;+ and later announced that Texture would &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/texture-to-shut-down-may-28/"&gt;cease working after May 28&lt;/a&gt;. On cue, the app no longer functions as of today and points users towards &lt;!----&gt;Apple News&lt;!----&gt;+.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BYSmMNde18" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, while Apple's notice in the Texture app says "don't worry, you can continue to read your favorite magazines" on &lt;!----&gt;Apple News&lt;!----&gt;+, the service is only available on the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/"&gt;iPod touch&lt;/a&gt;, and Mac. Texture supported multiple platforms, including iOS, macOS, Android, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/04/apple-shutting-down-texture-for-windows/"&gt;previously Windows&lt;/a&gt;.

		<description>Amazon today &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-introduces-echo-show-5-compact-design-rich-sound-and"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HZLHPKP"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt;, the latest Echo device with a 5.5-inch display, more compact design, and privacy-focused voice controls for Alexa. Echo Show 5 is priced at &amp;#36;89.99 and is set to launch on June 26, 2019.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Amazon's Echo Show devices have speakers and a touchscreen, aimed at letting customers watch the news via apps like NBC and Reuters, look at the weather, or make video calls. Echo Show 5 continues this idea, and Amazon even pointed out that you can use the device to listen to music via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/14/amazon-echo-apple-music-alexa/"&gt;thanks to recent integration&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/05/echo-show-5.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694890" /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like other Echo devices, Echo Show 5 can also act as a smart home hub so that you can say things like "Alexa, turn on the lights," or use on-screen display controls to adjust brightness levels. Smart camera feeds can be viewed on the display, as well as thermostat levels and more. Echo Show 5 also supports two-way talk functionality with Ring doorbell cameras.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
If you use the Echo Show 5 as an alarm clock, the device's display will naturally brighten and show a sunrise animation before the alarm goes off. At that time, you can set a routine that displays the weather forecast for the day, the morning news, and more on the Echo Show 5 screen.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Since we launched the first Echo Show device, customers have told us they love asking Alexa to show them things—whether it’s a recipe for banana bread, their shopping list, or music lyrics. With Echo Show 5, we’ve made it even easier and affordable for customers to add a smart display to every room of their house,” said Tom Taylor, Senior Vice President, Amazon Alexa. 
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
“The compact form factor is perfect for a bedside table or desk, plus it has a camera shutter for added peace of mind, and new Alexa privacy features for even more control.”&lt;/blockquote&gt; When not in use, you can set personal photos to act as a home screen on the Echo Show 5, or connect to Facebook to play a slideshow of photos as a screensaver. Echo Show 5 can connect to family members who own an Echo Spot or Echo Show, have the Alexa mobile app, or use Skype. Within the same house, if you own multiple Alexa devices you can also use the drop-in feature to quickly speak to other Alexa speakers.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
In terms of privacy, Amazon touched on a variety of security options in its announcement today. First, the company pointed out that Echo Show 5 includes a microphone/camera off button that electronically disconnects both the microphone and camera, along with a visual indicator that shows when audio or video is streaming to the cloud. The device also has a camera shutter so you can easily cover the camera.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Second, Amazon has introduced an easy way to delete your voice recordings on all of your Alexa devices: you can say, "Alexa, delete everything I said today." Afterwards, the company will delete the respective recordings. In the near future, you'll be able to delete your last request by saying, "Alexa, delete what I just said."
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Echo Show 5 is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HZLHPKP"&gt;available to pre-order&lt;/a&gt; today in Charcoal and Sandstone for &amp;#36;89.99. The device will then launch in June in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. India will see a launch in July, and Mexico will come at a later date.
